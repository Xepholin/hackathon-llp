This should probably be in Markdown but oh well

So for the Makefile, you can edit flags if you want, and it should be changed to be less a dumb giant script ; do note that some flags may be a bit different between gcc and armclang, so maybe a GCCFLAGS would make sense.

Be sure to load the gnu module for gcc and BOTH the gnu and acfl modules for amdclang!!!

Usage :
make -> compile BSM.cxx to tested_program.exe with g++
make armclang -> com BSM.cxx to tested_program.exe with armclang
make run -> run tested_program.exe on the cluster
make maqao -> run tested_program.exe on the cluster using MAQAO, for profiling purposes

BSM_ref.cxx is the base file, DO NOT change it.

BSM.cxx is the latest version of the optimized file, only push result that appear right in it. You're free to upload extra versions if you want, like BSM_changed_random.cxx for exemple (this file do not exist).

Used flags :
-mcpu=neoverse-512tvb -> Tunes the program for Graviton 4 ONLY, DO NOT RUN SUCH PROGRAM ON GRAVITON 3
-fopenmp -> OpenMP support
-funroll-loops -> Tells GCC to unroll loops which size can be determined at compile time (implies -frerun-cse-after-loop -fweb -frename-registers)
-ftree-vectorize -> This allows vectorization on trees (implies -ftree-vectorize -ftree-slp-vectorize, which are both included in O2)
-finline-functions -> Consider every function for inlining, even if not declared as such in the code. THIS IS INCLUDED STARTING O2 SO I GOTTA REMOVE IT.
-lamath -> Links ARM's math lib, which is good. THIS FLAG MUS BE SET BEFORE -lm.
-lm -> Math lib.
