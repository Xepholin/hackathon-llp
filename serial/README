This should probably be in Markdown but oh well

The Makefile should've been changed to be less a dumb giant script, but this version works so it's fine.

Be sure to load the gnu module for gcc and BOTH the gnu and acfl modules for amdclang!!!
Also you should always run the commands in the scripts/useful/init.sh before doings things on the machine.

Usage :
make -> compiles BSM.cxx to tested_program.exe with g++
make armclang -> compiles BSM.cxx to tested_program.exe with armclang
make run -> runs tested_program.exe on the cluster
make maqao -> runs tested_program.exe on the cluster using MAQAO, for profiling purposes

The experiments folder contains source files of different versions of the code.
The scripts folder contains some scripts we used, they may not all be pertinent.
The doc folder contains documentation provided for the Hackathon, not ours.

The results folder contains :
c7g* -> results on the Graviton 3 machine, with a 2 loops version of the program (cf experiments/BSMv7.exe), g++ and -lamath.
c8g* -> results on the Graviton 3 machine, with a 2 loops version of the program (cf experiments/BSMv7.exe), g++ and -lamath.
c8g*a -> results on the Graviton 4 machine, with latest version of the program (BSM.cxx), armclang++.
